In a <a href="">previous post</a> I said, <i>"So, Amazon is willing to host the documentation for this module but they’re not willing to mention it anywhere… What the heck?!"</i>. This is actually a mistake. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/peteskomoroch">Peter Skomoroch</a> for pointing out that the documentation is hosted on Amazon's S3 service, which is not the same as Amazon intentionally hosting something. It's possible they don't even know it's there.
