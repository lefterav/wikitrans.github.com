I am currently not handling paragraphs correctly. It didn't occur to me until I was looking at a rendered translation that the concept of paragraphs has disappeared. 

If you consider each sentence to be a "Constructicon":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructicons, I am now facing "Devastator":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devastator_%28Transformers%29.
